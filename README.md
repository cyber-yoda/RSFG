Hello and welcome, weary traveler! You have discovered something very strange indeed. My name is Trog, and this is my first Github Repo! 
This is a collection of Bash scrips that I created to learn the Linux command line, practice using basic commands, and to try stringing commands together. I decided to create a silly project that would use a variety of commands. 
The main program, RSFG, starts by generating a random file full of random words and characters. It then removes the random characters and sorts the file. It finally allows you to analyze the file. It has the option to delete the temp files it creates (located in the TempFiles folder) as well as a silent and a verbose mode. Have fun!

You can “install” this program by downloading the main folder, opening it in your Linux terminal, and typing “./RSFG”.
If you have any issues, uh, well I’m not sure what you expected to be honest. 

Please make sure to read through all the code before running anything, just to make sure it won’t damage your system. It should all be safe, however these are random scripts you downloaded off the internet. Its always a good idea to see what they do before running them.
