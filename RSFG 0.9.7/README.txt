	Hello, these are some very silly bash scripts I made.
	The main program is RSFG or Really-Silly-File-Generator.
	You can run it by opening the opening this folder in your terminal and running

		./RSFG

	Have fun. If you have any strange can't open file errors,
	try altering the envrioment varible at the top of each script to match your system.
	Also make sure to take a look through all the code before running any of it so you know what it does.
	Always a good idea for random stuff you dowloaded off the internet.
